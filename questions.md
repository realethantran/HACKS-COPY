<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>

<p>Start with the user in mind and use simple shapes and text to form an outline. Also be sure to get feedback early and often by various sources/individuals.</p>

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>

<p>User testing helps designers to understand how users interact with their designs. This feedback can be used to improve the design and make it more user-friendly. The Amazon Kindle was originally designed with a touchscreen display. However, user testing showed that users were having difficulty reading text on the touchscreen. As a result, the designers switched to an e-ink display, which is much easier to read.</p>

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>

<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework for developing websites and web applications. It is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap provides a collection of pre-made components and code snippets that can be used to create responsive, mobile-first websites.</p>

<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>

<p>Bootstrap is designed to be responsive, meaning that it will automatically adjust its layout to fit different screen sizes. This is important for websites that are accessed on a variety of devices, such as phones, tablets, and computers.
Bootstrap is also built using lightweight CSS and JavaScript, which makes it fast and efficient. This is important for websites that need to load quickly. Finally, Bootstrap is easy to use and learn. It has a well-documented API and a large community of users and developers who can help you if you get stuck.</p>

<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>

<p>To include Bootstrap in my website development, I can either download the Bootstrap framework and include it in your project, or I can use a Bootstrap starter template. Bootstrap starter templates are pre-made projects that include Bootstrap and other useful tools, such as a stylesheet, a JavaScript file, and a sample homepage.</p>

<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>

<p>Selectors are used to select elements in an HTML document. There are many different types of selectors, each of which selects elements in a different way. For example, the div selector selects all div elements in an HTML document. The #id selector selects an element with a specific ID attribute. The .class selector selects all elements with a specific class attribute.</p>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>

<p>ANSWER</p>

<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>

<p>ANSWER</p>

<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>

<p>Selection is the process of choosing between different options. In the snake game, the player must select which direction they want the snake to move. Iteration is the process of repeating a task a certain number of times. In the snake game, the snake's body is made up of a series of segments. Each segment is created by iterating over a list of coordinates. Sequencing is the process of arranging tasks in a specific order. In the snake game, the tasks of moving the snake, checking for collisions, and updating the display are all sequenced in a specific order. The :root selector in CSS refers to the root element of the document. In the context of the snake game, the root element is the HTML div element that contains the game's canvas. The :root selector can be used to style the root element, or to apply styles to all of the elements in the document. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are all essential components of the snake game. HTML is used to create the game's structure, JavaScript is used to control the game's logic, and CSS is used to style the game's visuals. Together, these three languages create the final product: a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.</p>
